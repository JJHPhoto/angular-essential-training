## Workflow

I copied over the beginning files from `branch '02_01b' ` of the repo I cloned down. Then I installed the dependencies with `npm i`. Hopefully this works out and I can follow along in this repo. I noticed that the `.gitignore` from the cloned repo became a copy since I already had a `gitignore` in my repo. I decided to copy what the cloned repo was ignoring into my `gitignore`.
