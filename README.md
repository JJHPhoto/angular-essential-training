Course from LinkedIn Learning by Justin Schwartzenberger

## Workflow

I copied over the beginning files from `branch '02_01b' ` of the repo I cloned down. Then I installed the dependencies with `npm i`. Hopefully this works out and I can follow along in this repo. I noticed that the `.gitignore` from the cloned repo became a copy since I already had a `gitignore` in my repo. I decided to copy what the cloned repo was ignoring into my `gitignore`.

After getting that set up, it was a matter of following along in the course. There were a few things that I had to double check. This was for a few reasons. I had created a new repo for this course so that I could make the project on my Github. I did copy over a lot of the files but I also hand wrote a lot of the code. Because of this, some mistypes or not having updates to certain files caused some errors. Thankfully, I have been able to find where the issues have been on my end and correct them. I enjoy studying this way because it helps me to integrate the material into my mind. If I just cloned the repo down and followed along with the answers, I feel like I wouldn't have enjoyed this course as much.
